# cpsc419-final-proj

Group 18

Group 18's final project is to build out a platform for subletters and sublettees to connect and streamline the process. It will provide an online space for people who would like to sublet their spaces to post listings and match with people looking for a sublease. We will use a listing system so the people who want to sublet can easily filter and find a place that matches their needs and specifications. Then, the potential subletter will be able to send a message to owners of the places they are interested in and coordinate contracts as needed.

Instructions to run:
1. Start the MySQL server (install and populate if not previously done)
2. Start backend with "python app.py"
3. Start frontend by cd into frontend folder and running "npm start"
